### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust, C, Elixir, Svelte, Go.

ğŸ“š I'm well versed in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, React, Frontend, RESTful APIs.

ğŸ–‹ I'm currently working on something _secret_ ğŸ‘€ , with plans to open up the code later this year.

ğŸ”­ I wrote [findit](https://github.com/tbauer428/findit), something kind of analogous to vims search feature, but written in Rust.

<!-- ğŸ“– I'm currently reading [Empire of the Summer Moon by S. C. Gwynne](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/books/review/excerpt-empire-of-the-summer-moon.html) -->

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his

ğŸ’» Here is my Neovim config for those curious: [init.vim](https://github.com/tbauer428/nvimrc/blob/main/init.vim)
