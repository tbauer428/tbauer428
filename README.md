### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, WebAssembly, C, Kotlin, Godot

📚 I'm well versed in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, React, Frontend, RESTful APIs.

🖋 I'm currently working on something _secret_ 👀, with plans to open up the code later this year.

🔭 I wrote [findit](https://github.com/tbauer428/findit), something kind of analgous to vims search feature, but written in Rust.

📖 I'm currently reading [Empire of the Summer Moon by S. C. Gwynne](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/11/books/review/excerpt-empire-of-the-summer-moon.html)

😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
